Chapters
========

A line is marked as a chapter by using any number of # or $ in front of
it. Optionally, a manual id can be given by typing an id after |.

Chapters starting with # will be visible in the table of contents and
have numbering, while chapters starting with $ will not be listed in
the table of contents and will not have numbering.

Note: If no manual id is given it is generated automatically by taking
the chapter title and replacing all non-id characters (see below) to _.

Example:

# Top chapter | top
## Sub chapter 1
### Sub chapter 2

Note 2: Nested chapters will be given automatic ids in the form of
top-sub1-sub2 and so on.

Page number
===========

Inserts a link to the page of a given id

Example: See @pageref(top).

Note: Not all exporters can support this, as not all media has paging.
Non-paged exporters should create a generic link instead, e.g. "here".

Ids
===

An id is a symbol identifying a unique piece of the document. The id
must be unique even across content types.

Ids can only contain the following symbols:
a-z _ -

Any id given not conforming to this will be forced to do so by replacing
any illegal characters with _.

Files / templates
=================

Other report writer files can be inserted in a document

@file(filename.txt)

This can be used to split up chapters, or create templates, see
variables below.

Variables
=========

Variables can be set in a document and used later in the same document,
or in a document included after it, see above.

Example:

$title = Document Title
$author = Mystery Author X
# $title - $author

Result:

# Document Title - Mystery Author X

Note: Variables follow the same naming rules as ids.

Special formatting
==================

Vertical padding (mostly used for the front page) can be inserted by
writing lines only containing #.

Example: #
